# Simple Java Docker Practice 🐳🚀

Welcome to the **Simple Java Docker Practice** repository! This repo is solely created for practicing Docker with Java applications. Here, I experiment with Docker commands, Dockerfiles, and containerizing simple Java apps.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here:

* Basic Java applications to test Docker concepts.
* Dockerfiles to build and run Java containers.
* Sample commands for building and running Docker containers.

## 🚀 Purpose:

This repository is purely for Docker practice and experimentation. Feel free to explore, learn, and test.

## 📦 How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alok77it/Simple-java-docker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Simple-java-docker
   ```

3. Build the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker build -t java-docker-app .
   ```

4. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm java-docker-app
   ```
